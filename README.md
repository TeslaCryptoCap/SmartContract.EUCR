# Usage (getting started)
All functionalities of contracts are well described in the code itself.
TODO.

# Requirements (prerequest) and installation
The contracts don't have any requirements and no additional software should be installed.

# Deployment
In order to deploy eucr.sol, one must have enough ether and must provide the constructor with the initial address that is going to be authorized for certain actions.  

### Running the tests
Testing may be performed on Kovan, or any other testnet. The easiest way to test all contracts's functions is to deploy them to the testnet using some injected web3 (Metamask: https://metamask.io/) through Remix Solidity IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
Remix will display all functions after deployment.
